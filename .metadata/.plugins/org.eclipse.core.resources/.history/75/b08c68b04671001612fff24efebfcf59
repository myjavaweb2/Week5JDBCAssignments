	<h2>A Brief History of the National Basketball Association</h2>

	<p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) is one of the most
	important professional sport associations in North America. The NBA 
	was founded in 1946 in New York City, New York. It is widely considered 
	to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. It 
	has 30 teams which are all based in the United States except for 1 that 
	is based in Canada. Over the years, a lot of the NBA players have amassed 
	lot of wealth because they are paid handsomely than anyone can every dream 
	of earning from regular mearge paying jobs. As a result, almost everyone 
	want to become professional basketball players. Unfortunately, it requires 
	some supreme basketball skills to become a professional basketball player 
	and not everyone is so endowed with those unique high sportsmanship skills. 
	Its been over 70 years now since the founding of the NBA and over that 
	period of time, a lot of players have become so famous for being one of 
	the greatest basketball players.</p>
